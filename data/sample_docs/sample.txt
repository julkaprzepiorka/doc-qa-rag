Artificial Intelligence is a field of computer science focused on building systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence, such as understanding language or recognizing images.

Machine learning is a subfield of AI. It is based on algorithms that learn patterns from data instead of being explicitly programmed. With enough examples, these models can make predictions or classify new information.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of machine learning model trained on very large text datasets. They can answer questions, summarize long documents, and generate human-like text.
